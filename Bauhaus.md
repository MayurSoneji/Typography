#Bauhaus

##When Did It Start And End

Bauhaus started in 1919 and ended in 1933.

##Context

World War 1 was lost by germany. The loss led to high unemployment due to the damage that was created. There was very high unemployment rates. Throughout the time, the most surprising thing is the Bauhaus starting up with all the crisis’ going on around it. More money had to be printed which led to an inflation of currency. You can see the man with the wheelbarrow full of money. This amount of money shockingly is just to buy a loaf of bread. Money became so worthless that they used it as lego blocks.

##What Influenced Bauhaus?

The Bauhaus was heavily influenced by Arts And Crafts and follows most of its principles. In addition to the A&C movement, the Bauhaus was influenced by De Stijl, and Russian Constructivism. You can see from these images of what had influenced the Bauhaus to originate. Throughout this presentation we will be taking the journey to see how they have been influenced by the work of these three movements. Using the idea of Arts and Craft has no distinction. It makes the fine artists and craftsmen appear to be equal rather than be treated next to nothing. The Bauhaus is sort of like a solution for the average man to become an artists by learning from the masters and then developing their own unique style.

##Bauhaus Schools

The Bauhaus have had three different locations since starting up. The first being in Weimar, this institution was founded by Walter Gropius. Walter Gropius was an architect. The Weimar institute closed in 1925 where a new institution popped up, consider it a refurbishment. The new location was based in Dessau which was still led by Walter, in 1928 Walter had decided to hand over to Hannes Meyer who was still an architect. Hannes was only in charge for two years and had handed over the throne in 1930 to Ludwig Mies van der Rohe who led it until the closure in 1933. Ludwig was also an architect.

###Herbert Bayer

Herbert Bayer was born on April 5, 1900 in Hungary. Herbert Bayer was an iconic person due to his wide range of studies. Bayer had worked as a graphical designer, painter, photographer as well as many more things. He could be one of the most talented masters the Bauhaus had. Most of the Bauhaus publications created by Herbert Bayer feature lowercase sans serif typefaces when published. We shall take a look after to see a few examples of where this is applied. Bayer had worked on a typeface for five years, from 1925 to 1930, during his time at the Bauhaus. The font was called univeral. This font has inspired more fonts such as Architype Bayer and ITC Bauhaus.

This is some of Herbert Bayers publications for the Bauhaus. As I mentioned before, Bayer used sans-serif typefaces. The first one is the example of the lowercase letters which have the clean crisp look. You can see heavy influence from De Stijl which has the clean use of geometric shapes and blocks of colour, especially in the first image. Some elements appear flat and have been coloured in by a flat colour. The 3D elements have shade as well as dumped colour. De Stijl is flat colours, you can see Herbert Bayer has developed they style further by adding shadows to the 3D elements. The one thing all of these publications have in common is the sans-serif typefaces used all across. With Bayer’s history with developing his typeface, he has used it in the first publication again. The only thing different is the arrow pointing up.

##Why Did Bauhaus Close?

Hitler was in charge of the Nazi army. Hitler had tried his best to be a talented artist however he did not reach the potential to become an artist. In an act of jealousy, Hitler pressured his army to force the Bauhaus to close down. The artists had fled to America to avoid being killed by Hitler.

Hitler was also afraid of modernism and preferred things the traditional ways over the way the Bauhaus had completed their work more modern. This was one reason Hitler had pressured the Bauhaus. One other reason was the Bauhaus was considered left wing, Hitler hated anything left wing and preferred right wing.

Hitler had murdered some of the Bauhaus making the rest flee to different countries.

Despite the Bauhaus closing down, the work and the principles they had created was not forgotten. The Bauhaus was a start which influenced other movements.
