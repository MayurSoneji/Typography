#CIA

In this I tried my best to blur out the Confirm and Deny because they were the main things that stood out. It did not really work well as it wasn't appealing to grab attention.

I then retried the same quote and thought of using the idea of the seal. Becuase it was the Bauhaus movement, I had to try my best to use Sans-Serif type, I used Serif for the circular text primarily for the recognition.

#Can You Hear Me? _Ear_

![Ear 1](https://github.com/MayurSoneji/Typography/blob/master/Image%20files/Ear---Can-you-hear-me-1.png "Ear 1")

The idea is straightforward here, its type on a path in the shape of an ear.

Upon reflecting, some people did not see it as an ear so I added a little bit more detail.

#Ed Balls

This was just me experimenting the typography which has no real meaning, it was my base.

I tried to use negative space however it was not relevant to the quote.

Ed Balls has accidentaly tweeted his name, so I though to erase some of the tweet to show this.

Given feedback based on my previous idea, some people could not see it as it being rubbed out therefore I tried another approach, I still prefer the first one because when people rub things out, it is generally messy. This idea still shows the quote and it masks out some of the name.

#Justice

![Justice 1](https://github.com/MayurSoneji/Typography/blob/master/Image%20files/Justice-1.png "Justice 1")

In this one, it was the hierachy I was more interested in, it was my main idea showing Justice at the top and Just Us at the bottom. The main emphasis was on System Broken.

I tried to illustrate hierachy with a triangle.

#Can You Hear Me?

![Ear 1](https://github.com/MayurSoneji/Typography/blob/master/Image%20files/Can-You-Hear-me-old.png "Ear 1")

This is the idea I had at first, upon review, it was hard to see the quote.

So I thickened it up.
